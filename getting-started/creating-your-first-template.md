# Creating your first template

DocuZen enables you to design and generate dynamic PDFs. Send an invoice, create tickets, or produce reports. You don't need to write any HTML or worry about the template not rendering as expected. Create a new template and select **Preview**, and the PDF appears right inside your browser.

### Dynamic PDF generation

PDFs are a ubiquitous technology with a variety of use cases. Typically, PDFs are generated dynamically to include data specific to the recipient (like an order confirmation document). Dynamic PDFs are generated on the fly using PDF generation software.

A DocuZen template includes the design of a dynamic PDF, as well as placeholders for where data will be injected when the PDF is generated.

### Creating a PDF template

When you're ready, open DocuZen and create your first PDF template.

1. Click **Templates** in the sidebar to open the Templates area
2. Click the **New Template** button in the top-right corner of the screen

DocuZen immediately opens the new PDF template in the template editor.
