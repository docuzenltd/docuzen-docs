# Managing your account

Having a free DocuZen account allows you to [create](generating-your-first-pdf.md) Docuzen Templates to implement dynamic PDF generation in your apps without writing any HTML. With DocuZen, you can also [use static HTML to generate PDFs](../generating-pdfs/generating-pdfs-from-html.md) for backward compatibility with your existing PDF solutions.

Upgrading your account is optional, and you can use DocuZen without doing so if you prefer. If you do want to upgrade, continue to the Upgrading your account section.
