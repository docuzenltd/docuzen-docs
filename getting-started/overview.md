# Getting started

Welcome! This section of the docs contains guidance on how to begin using DocuZen.

To get started with DocuZen, check out the following:

* You can get started without installing any software by using the [DocuZen web app](https://app.docuzen.co) to create a Free DocuZen account.
* Once you're in DocuZen, have a look at [how to get around](navigating-docuzen.md). After this, try [creating your first template](creating-your-first-template.md).
* After you've created a template, you'll want to generate your first PDF. Take a look at [creating an API key](creating-an-api-key.md) and [generating your first PDF](generating-your-first-pdf.md).
* Learn more about [managing your account](managing-your-account.md).
